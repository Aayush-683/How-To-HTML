            <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
            <p> Our <b>JavaScript Tutorial</b> is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to
                create client-side dynamic pages.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is an <i>object-based scripting language</i> which is lightweight and cross-platform.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator
                (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.</p>

            <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites
                for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
                interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for
                adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by
                all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact
                directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms
                of interactivity and simplicity</p>
            <p>Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and
                provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers,
                databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.</p>
            <h1>Features of JavaScript</h1>
            <p>There are following features of JavaScript:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
                <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured
                    programming language.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the
                    operation).</li>
                <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes
                    for inheritance.</li>
                <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
                <li>It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
                <li>It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>
            <p>In 1993,<b> Mosaic</b>, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the <b>year 1994,
                    Netscape</b> was founded by <b>Marc Andreessen</b>. He realized that the web needed to become more
                dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for
                designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited <b>Brendan Eich</b>
                intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could
                start, the company merged with <b>Sun Microsystems</b> for adding Java into its Navigator so that it
                could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there:
                Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting
                language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code
                of Javascript named '<b>Mocha</b>'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with
                '<b>LiveScript</b>'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the
                language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.</p>

            <h1>Application of JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side validation,</li>
                <li>Dynamic drop-down menus,</li>
                <li>Displaying date and time,</li>
                <li>Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt
                    dialog box),</li>
                <li>Displaying clocks etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>JavaScript Example</h1>
            <div class="codeblock">
                <h2>Input:</h2>
                <code>
                    &lt;html&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;JavaScript Example&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert('Say Hello To JavaScript');<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/html&gt;
                </code>
                <h2>Output:</h2>
                <button onclick="alert('Say Hello To JavaScript')">Run Script</button>
            </div>
        </div>
